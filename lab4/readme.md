# Lab4 - Tcache

In this lab we are going to learn about tcache exploitation.

## makefile
Generally you don't need to interact with this file at all.

## hell.c baby.c easy.c
The source files for the challenge. If you are not familiar with reversing binaries, use them as a reference.

## execution environment
You **must** execute all these challenges in a libc-2.27 environment or else they may be either 'too-easy' to exploit or 'too-hard' to exploit.
